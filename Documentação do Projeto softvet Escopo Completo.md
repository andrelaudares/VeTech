# **VeTech \- Comprehensive Project Scope**

## **1\. Executive Summary**

This document outlines the complete scope for a veterinary SaaS, called the VeTech platform designed to connect veterinary clinics with their clients (pet owners). The platform features a dual-interface system with separate portals for clinics and pet owners, enabling streamlined communication, health monitoring, and personalized care plans.

The business model is subscription-based, with tiered pricing for veterinary clinics depending on the number of clients/animals they can register. The platform will use Supabase for database management and Python for backend development, with responsive web design to ensure compatibility across both desktop and mobile devices.

## **2\. System Architecture**

### **2.1 High-Level Architecture**

The platform will utilize a modern multi-tier architecture:
